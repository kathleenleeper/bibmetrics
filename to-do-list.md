#Bibliometrics: to-do list

- [ ] clean up bibtex file to only use included refs, rather than all available
- [ ] pyzotero: include multiple collections at once
- [ ] compare journals to DOAJ list of access types
  - [ ] list of journals with licenses
  - [ ] standardize zotero journal fields
  - [ ] standardize license (or do stacked bar chart -- i.e. closed vs open, but which percentage are CC-BY vs CC-SA?

## some thoughts on databases
- pubmed
- arxiv
- PLoS has a sweet searchable database <3
- crossref (DOI resolution, sometimes affiliation, usually full names)
- WoS (what a fucking pain, but also it's so dumb and complete for what it includes)
- dblp - computer science database
 - python wrapper for searching it - http://blog.rguha.net/?p=775

### inspo w. Python:
- python bibliotools - http://www.sebastian-grauwin.com/?page_id=427
 - python scripts for working w. downloaded WoS data
 - requires manual downloading of info (ugh) and manual clean up for parsing of place information
 - publication: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-011-0482-y
- a little script that analyzes pub med author data - http://blog.rguha.net/?p=775
