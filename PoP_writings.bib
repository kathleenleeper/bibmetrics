abstract = {The “Sex and the City Voter” construct as it was deployed in political journalism and popular culture during the 2004 campaign is problematic. Although it seem- ingly promoted young women's political agency, the potency of the image came from its characterization of young women voters as a homogenous group of white, middle- to upper-class professionals, as consumers rather than citizens, and as sexually appealing and available. The construct's assimilation into popular cul- ture and political journalism mirrored earlier attempts by the media to charac- terize feminism in the late 1990s, where emphasis was placed on young women as so-called “third wave” feminists. The 2004 campaign offers an important case study of third-wave feminist logic as it was appropriated and infused in campaign discourse and political journalism.},

	={\textgreater} analysis of idealogical and symbolic intertwining of race/power in America
		*outlines of broad critical race theory - how racial power is produced, mediated, and legitimated

        
techniques convincing jury of "reasonableness" of beating linked to struggle in different legal arena about race-conscious affirmative action -- conflict over whether south LA is "insurrection" or "riot of the mob"
	which narrative structure will prevail in the interpretation of events?

        
the video tape -- clear evidence of brutality -- allowed political right to be oppose clear cut racism in opposition to their anti-affirmative action standpoint -- in order to say it{\&}{\#}039;s not linked to racial supremacy issues

        
broad consensus of {\&}{\#}039;racism{\&}{\#}039; --{\textgreater} video did not mean the same to everyone

        
cultural consensus imploding in south LA violence - limits of formal legal equality apparent

        

        

        
          
king{\&}{\#}039;s courtroom video
        
transference of video -{\textgreater} stills that could be analyzed by {\&}{\#}039;experts{\&}{\#}039; -- in any given moment it was textbook violence, not excessive
	reweaving into narrative of police-approved restraint techniques
	videotape images physically mediated by illustration board; in moment of disaggregation they were symbolically mediated by new narrative backdrops

        
explanations for the King verdict: most differentiate King verdict too much from other production/exercises of racial power OR make the particular judgement subordinate to an overly instumental view of law/mediating idealogies

        
in some sense, legal is political realm	
	mistake to see narratives as after the fact story concocted after real power has been exercised
	King verdict was typical, not extraordinary

        
          
issuance of supreme court opinions

        
        Richmond vs Croson
        
	unconstitutional: awarding construction contracts ona race conscious, affirmative-action basis
	decided both Blacks and whites can suffer when racial classifications are used, so "color blindness" could equate the legal significance of benefiting white contractors (by excluding blacks) with legal consequences of benefitting Black contractors (requiring set asides)

        
because there was no "proof" of Blacks being unfairly treated prior to Richmond law, similar disaggregation of racial disparity
	isolation of elements from meaning-giving context
	court considered each piece individually; by itself any piece wasn{\&}{\#}039;t sufficient co conclude discrimination

        
part of the appeal of "formal legal equality" - belief grossest forms of racial discrimination irae straightforward and objective - not dependent on "subjective" evaluations --{\textgreater} even clear things can be subverted by racial power

        
Rodney King exemplified old-style mode of racial domination; vs "disagreements" of multiculturalism
	separating these two is product of narrative;
	contrast b/t arenas; from "narrative" and "disaggregation" the "formal equality" vs "special treatment" fades =={\textgreater} idencation on which narratives are believed
distinction -- formal equality can be achieved because it can be objectively identified by law
King verdict represents not corrupt subversion of legal values, but rather idealogical belief in the rule of law

          

        disaggregation: tried to describe features of dominant form of contemporary  race idealogy-- linking police aquittal with race narratives of mainstream legal culture
	divorcing the effects of racial power from social context and historic meaning

        
color blind- image of racial power as embodied in abstract classifications; could run either way, equally against whites and blacks

        

        
"laws" and "facts" of social world do not exist in any objective, ready-made form -- must be interperted according to politics, ideology, and power

        
belief in "formal equality" --{\textgreater} extreme disillusionment by many (particularly integrationist-oriented) blacks who invested more than symbolic meaning in guarantees of objectivity
	believed baton -{\textgreater} skull would speak for itself

        
	rather than providing firm ground, notions of formal equality, objectivity, neutrality, and the like tend to obscure the way race is experienced by majority of African Americans

        
investment of meanings:
	source of excitement that technology would be utilized in service of the masses
		assumption that such conduct was regular feature of interactions b/t police and Blacks in LA
	some saw video tape as awful but exceptional, part of another era which happened to be caught on video
		"proved" brutality, but the brutality was random

        
	for some, critical to comprehending that brutality "still" occurs in americann society
	vs others for which it simply documented something they already knew

        

        
deep idealogical connection b/t need for and embrace of "proof" -- special status of King tape as objective proof is social construct, just as the interpretation by the jury was
	perceptions not just physiology, but on interpretation of tape

        
valorizing "objective proof" problematic:
	marginalizes as subjective those whose realities of ALSO being beaten by police are {\&}{\#}039;merely{\&}{\#}039; word-of-mouth and community experience of LAPD--devalues their experience 

        
videotape images do not mean as a matter of objectivity, but as matter of social construction
          
	we see the same videotape but add diff narrative and it would be {\&}{\#}039;okay{\&}{\#}039;

        narratives must be part of image to give them life
	judgement mediated by background narratives

        
different images underlying first impressions -{\textgreater} make sense of differing reactions to verdict
	sharpest line: those who took to the streets and those (police-department personnel) who cheered the news
	most mainstream culture deplored the "rioting" while also deploring the riot
		trying to preserve the value they thought impugned - the value of rule of law

        
dominant public discourse: opposition b/t those urging restraint {\&} advocating respect VERSUS "no justice, n piece"
	---{\textgreater} objective, reasoned, responsible reaction VS emotional, passionate, irresponsible one

        which you can totally see now in the image of angry women etc etc -- "objectivity" versus not being allowed to get angry at things

        
        

        
competing view of Rodney King episode: insurrection
	rather than beating as aberration, insurrection is focused on power relations and dynamics b/t rio
	not deviation, but part of systemic social dynamic: anglo police force for sprawling metropolis in fortified cruisers dispatched from remote location; historical history of police brutality towards Blacks that is the subject of investigation, expert commision seport, and inaction
	insurrection: uprising as communal response to larger issues of social power

        

        
Kerner commission: concluded "riots"  expressed frustrations w/slow pace of integration
	required misinterpreting Black Nationalist rhetoric and impositioning of integrationist view of racial justice
	dominant reaction evidences same ideological framing of issue: no place for ideas like 
	"community control over police, education, and other public services, because the Black community, say, is no longer even perceived--there are just people who {\&}{\#}039;happen to be Black{\&}{\#}039;"

        
relations b/t communities cannot be mediated in neutral fashion through recognition of formal legal rights

        
believing issues are subject to interpretation does not mean everything is relative "anything goes since its all power anyway" 

        
LA Blacks live in diff world from whites--understanding distance means comprehending relations not of norms of universal treatment/equality, but rule of one community over another

        
not color blindness on part of police force, but power redistribution so the police is integrated into the black community in LA -- so the community has actual control over its enforcers

conceptual bases, indroduces key issuse
	concept of race as a {\&}{\#}039;white{\&}{\#}039; rather than {\&}{\#}039;black{\&}{\#}039; problem
	distinction b/t overt and inferential racism
	typology of racial stereotypes
		"slave figure", "native", "clown/entertainer"

        
racism must be understood in terms of structures, practices, and discourses--not something coming from any one individual

        
issues being address: 
	how the media (deliberately or unconsciously) defines/constructs questions of race in such a way as to reproduce idealogies
	problems of strategies and tactics which arise when left attemps to intervene in media construction of race

        
racist "common sense" pervasive in society
	in addition to blocking path of openly racist, construct anti racist common sense

        
          
defining the terms of the argument
idealogy not isolated/separate concepts - same concept differently positioned w/in logic of different idealogical discourses
	idealogical statements made by individuals; not the product of individual consciousness or intention - intentions formulated w/in idealogy 
		processes work unconsciously
	idealogies construct positions of identification/knowledge for subjects

        
idealogies work by transforming the discoruses and of subjects-for-action
	site of distinct social struggle

        
classic definition: regards it as dependent sphere, but this is reductive

        
	certain idealogical discrouses do have well defined connections with certain class places

        
apparatuses that generate and circulate ideologies:media! is source of ideas - also articulates, works on, transforms, and elaborates
	media is not uniformally harnessed to single racist conception
          
the writer seems to think the Guardian isn{\&}{\#}039;t at all problematic but like what really i don{\&}{\#}039;t
        

        
no unified conspiratorial media or unified racist {\&}{\#}039;ruling class{\&}{\#}039;

        

        
task of critical theory: produce accurate knowledge of complex social processes as the complexity of their functionaing allows

        

        
overt vs inferential racism:
	overt: when open and favourable coverage given to arguments/positions/spokesperson in the business of elaborating openly racist and advancing racist policies
	inferential: naturalised representations of events/situations related to race which have racist premises/propositions  as set of unquestioned assumptions

        
both kinds found in british media;

        
idealogical discourse does not depend on the conscious intentions of those formulating statements within it

        
historical construction of race relations:	
	1. imagery/themes polarised around fixed relations of subordination and domination
	2. stereotypes grouped around poles of {\&}{\#}039;superior{\&}{\#}039; and {\&}{\#}039;inferior{\&}{\#}039; natural species
	3. displaced from the {\&}{\#}039;language{\&}{\#}039; of history into language of Nature
		physical signs and racial characteristics ={\textgreater} signifiers of inferiority

        
relations secured by economic/social/political/military domination transformed into order of natural rank

        
        
tropes
	slave fiure: dependable, loving, simple, also unreliable, unpredictable, and undependable -- capable of turning cutthroat and inexplicably given to running away into the bush

        
primitivism defined by fixed proximity of people to Nature

        
while these particular versions, have faded, the traces are still there
	restless native hords: guerilla armies and freedom fighters in the Angole, Zimbabwe, or Namibian {\&}{\#}039;bush{\&}{\#}039;

        
	native: primitive nobility, simple dignity---cheating and cunning, and savagery and barbarism -- cannibals are constantly threating to overrun the screen
		they move as anonymous mass vs the isolated white figure, alone confronting his destiny
	clown/entertainer: captures "innate" humor - putting on a show

        
all images are ambivalent -- doulbe vision of the white eye
	nostalgia for innocence lost to civilaization, and  the threat of civilization being overrun/undermined by recurrence of savagery

        

        
dependent peoples are starving victims of the dhird world, waiting for technology or Aid to apper
blacks are "good movers" so rhythmic, so natural

          

        
        
there may come a time when black/white jokes can be told that don{\&}{\#}039;t reproduces racial categories

        
two other arenas: news, current affaiers
	race is constructed as a problem and as the site of conflict/debate
          

        	blacks appear as collective agent of civil disorder

        
on riot reports, media took police statement as authoritative account
	downgraded problems (growth/legitimacy of extreme right and anti-black street politics, and the racism/brutality of police) that had to be forced on to the media{\&}{\#}039;s agenda, over all the claims and lurid details

        
media functions in systematically racist manner--like saying you could change character of capitalist state by replacing personnel
	media has a set of practices not reducible to staffing individuals

        
particular set of idealogical discourses is capacity to constrain a very great variety of individuals - regardless of their nominal affiliations
	"idealogies by their forms" - position  requires anti-realist aesthetic 
		founded on a-historical of forms of television - said to all belond to same type of realism

        
not denying the importance of form; but suggesting only deconstructivist texts are truly revolutionary is one-sided view 
	lumping together a banal TV documentary and a real one is naive and simplistic

        so saying any media is bad media is a stupid thing basically?

        = too formal conception of form, which accepts the false dichotomy b/t form and content

        
	the net result is then - if dominant television is bad, avant-garde/deconstructivist narratives are good 
		but that{\&}{\#}039;s a stupid position too "loony", if you will

        
truly difficult problem of both revolutionary form AND revolutionary content

        
our mode of political calculation is the taking of absolutist positions ={\textgreater} advance of sectarian self-righteousness and fragmentation
	as if there is some true theory of political struggle -- but actually jk we have no idea how things work
	putting tactics in one direction is "winning the odd dramatic skirmish at the risk of losing the war"},
